## Getting Started

The content of this repository is the folder of the Eclipse project. The controller is in the competition.uhu.controller package. To train the controller execute MainTraining.java. To test it run MainPrueba.java. A simple demonstration of the results [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B2_XZuGi2g)
